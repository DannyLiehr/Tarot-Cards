# Tarot Card Interpreter
[Go to the Github Page here](https://dannyliehr.github.io/Tarot-Cards/)

This is just a page for me to easily interpret my tarot card readings. I got tired of flipping back and forther constantly between tabs or between pages in a book, so I made this. The current JSON file came from [Tarot API](https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api). I just didn't want to constantly hit their endpoint while testing!

If you search for cards, you can type in values like "5 of Cups" or even incomplete values like "tower". It will return the **first matching card**, so typing just "Pentacles" will bring up "Page of Pentacles". Keep this in mind.

If this is useful to you, feel free to use it!
